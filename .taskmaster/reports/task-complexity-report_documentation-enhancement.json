		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Complete README.md Rewrite",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the README.md rewrite task into subtasks for each major section, including research, writing, diagram creation, and review phases.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive documentation across 11 distinct sections with varying complexity. While primarily a writing task, it requires deep understanding of the system architecture, AWS services integration, and current implementation details. The need for diagrams, proper formatting, and technical accuracy increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Package Test Suite Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database package test suite implementation into subtasks for each test category, including setup helpers, core operations, error conditions, and concurrency testing.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive test suite from scratch requires deep understanding of the database operations, SQLite specifics, and Go testing patterns. The task involves complex scenarios like concurrency testing, error simulation, and mock implementations. The high coverage target (>90%) and need for in-memory database setup add technical complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Model Package Test Suite Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the model package test suite implementation into subtasks for each model type, including serialization tests, validation tests, relationship tests, and test fixture creation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating tests for data structures with various validation rules and relationships. The complexity comes from testing JSON serialization, boundary conditions, and model relationships. While similar to task 2, it's slightly less complex as it focuses on data structures rather than database operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "API Package Enhanced Test Coverage",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the API package test coverage enhancement into subtasks for AWS Secrets Manager testing, SSO authentication testing, access token resolution testing, and SimpleFIN client error handling testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires mocking multiple AWS services, handling authentication flows, and simulating various error conditions. The existing partial coverage (45.2%) means understanding current tests before extending them. Mocking AWS services and testing asynchronous operations adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Main Package Test Suite Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the main package test suite implementation into subtasks for service initialization testing, helper function testing, AWS credential validation, database initialization testing, and graceful shutdown testing.",
			"reasoning": "Testing the main package is complex because it orchestrates all other components and handles service lifecycle. Mocking dependencies, testing signal handling, and validating shutdown sequences require sophisticated test approaches. The dependencies on other packages (2, 3, 4) indicate integration complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Integration Test Suite Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration test suite implementation into subtasks for end-to-end workflow testing, AWS SSO authentication testing, Secrets Manager testing, SimpleFIN API integration testing, database persistence testing, and error recovery testing.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex testing task as it requires orchestrating the entire system with multiple external dependencies. Setting up Docker containers, mocking AWS services, and creating test fixtures for all components requires significant effort. The dependencies on tasks 2-5 highlight its integrative nature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "AWS SSO Authentication Documentation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AWS SSO authentication documentation and testing task into subtasks for documentation creation, authentication flow testing, token management testing, error handling testing, and permission verification testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task combines documentation and testing of a complex AWS service integration. Understanding and documenting the SSO authentication flow requires deep AWS knowledge. Testing token lifecycle, permission verification, and error recovery scenarios adds technical complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "AWS Secrets Manager Integration Documentation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AWS Secrets Manager integration documentation and testing task into subtasks for documentation creation, secret operations testing, error handling testing, credential rotation testing, and permission verification testing.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to task 7, this combines documentation and testing of AWS service integration. Secrets Manager operations are somewhat simpler than SSO authentication, but still require understanding of AWS security concepts, IAM permissions, and credential management best practices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "SQLite Database Documentation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the SQLite database documentation and testing task into subtasks for schema documentation, operations documentation, migration documentation, performance optimization documentation, database testing, and concurrency testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires documenting and testing the database layer with SQLite. Creating schema diagrams, documenting SQL operations, and testing database functionality requires database expertise. The performance considerations and concurrent access testing add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "SimpleFIN API Integration Documentation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the SimpleFIN API integration documentation and testing task into subtasks for API overview documentation, authentication documentation, endpoint documentation, response parsing documentation, error handling documentation, and API testing implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves documenting and testing third-party API integration. Understanding the SimpleFIN API, authentication mechanisms, and response formats requires research. Creating mock servers and testing various response scenarios adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling and Recovery Documentation and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling and recovery documentation and testing task into subtasks for error classification documentation, recovery strategy documentation, retry policy documentation, logging integration documentation, error simulation testing, and recovery testing.",
			"reasoning": "This cross-cutting task requires understanding error handling across all system components. Documenting and testing recovery strategies, retry policies, and graceful degradation requires system-wide knowledge. Simulating various failure scenarios and validating recovery adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Final Validation and Documentation Consistency Check",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the final validation task into subtasks for documentation validation, test validation, and consistency checking across all components.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily a verification effort across all previous tasks. While it requires attention to detail and comprehensive understanding of the system, it's less technically complex than implementation tasks. The dependencies on all previous tasks (1-11) highlight its verification nature."
